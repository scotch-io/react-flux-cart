react-flux-cart
===============

## Overview

**Original branch** was coded for the tutorial by [@kenwheeler](https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler): [Create a Shopping Cart Using React.js and Flux](https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-simple-shopping-cart-with-react-js-and-flux).

This forked branch has additional features below:

* Up-to-date React v0.14 migrated, including seperated ReactDOM package and tons of new features as well as deprecations. If you are still using v0.12 as the original project, please check out the upgrade guides of [v0.13](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/10/react-v0.13.html) and [v0.14](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html).
* All JavaScript bundled with Webpack.
* Babel instead of JSX transformer introduced.
* Underscore.js discarded. It was total overkill for just object merging. Instead, `react/lib/Object.assign` is used.
* `http-server` for powering the server.

**Updated:**

* `http-server` deprecated, `webpack-dev-server` introduced instead.
* `react-hot-loader` introduced as a livereload watcher.
* `bundle.js` compressed with `uglify-loader`, size shrunk considerably.
* Preprocessing styles in Sass. Related packages are added to compile Sass into `bundle.js`.

## Install

1. Make sure you have *npm* and maybe *webpack* installed globally.

3. `npm install`
4. `npm start` to build the bundle with Webpack, and power the server.
5. Visit `localhost: 8080` and begin shopping.

There will be plenty adjustments in the future. Below are those in the picture:

* ES2015 (ECMAScript 6) migration.
* ~~Preprocess styles with Sass.~~ **Done.**
* ~~Gulp for translating Sass and minifying images.~~ **Canceled.**
* ~~Webpack Dev Server instead of http-server.~~ **Done.**
* ~~Livereload.~~ **Done.**
